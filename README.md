# Dyni Zaaba - Data Analytics Learning-Progress
## About
Hello, I'm Dyni! With a background in civil engineering and analytical research in Bioenergy, I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science. I have a strong foundation in technical design and a keen interest in using data to discover meaningful insights. As I transition to becoming an entry-level data analyst, I bring skills in problem-solving, data management, and statistical analysis from my engineering experience.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques. Whether working in teams or independently, I'm driven by the excitement of uncovering insights and using data to solve complex problems.
